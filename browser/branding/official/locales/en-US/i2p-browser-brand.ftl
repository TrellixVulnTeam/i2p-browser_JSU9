# that is used by Firefox) to avoid picking up the -brand-short-name values
# that Mozilla includes in the Firefox language packs.

-brand-short-name = I2P Browser

# This brand name can be used in messages where the product name needs to
# remain unchanged across different versions (Nightly, Beta, etc.).
